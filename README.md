# Times-Jobs-Web-Scraper
## Background
This is a personal, open scraping project on Times jobs website to collect information regarding job posting with certain required skills.
## Objective
My purpose with this project is to scrape the company name and the required skills necessary to perform the job and save these information in a csv file
that updates new jobs every 5 mins.
## Steps
1. Import Libraries
2. Connect to website and pull in data
3. Create a Timestamp for your output to track when data was collected.
4. Create csv and write headers and data into the file
5. Append data to the csv
6. Combine all the code into a function
7. Runs job finder after the set time and inputs data into your csv

## Obstacle
Most of the jobs being listed had multiple skills such as python, django, OS, linux and java and my current skills include just python and django.
I chose to filter out pyhton and django jobs and simply get the jobe with mainly these requirements.
